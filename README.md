# About

I have written server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including posters and a movie trailer URL.

Clone this repository directory and run the script entertainment_center.py. After downloading the project files, a movie trailer page can be created by importing media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py at the start of your Python script

# Steps to Run
 [Install Python 2.7] (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Open the terminal

Go in the folder where the program is stored
